    <h2>Arduino Blink Code</h2>
    <pre><code>
      // initializing LEDs to ports
      int led1 = 9; // red LED to port 9
      int led2 = 7; // blue LED to port 7
      int led3 = 5; // green LED to port 5

      // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
      void setup() {
        // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
        pinMode(led1, OUTPUT);
        pinMode(led2, OUTPUT);
        pinMode(led3, OUTPUT);

      }

      // the loop function runs over and over again forever
      void loop() {
        digitalWrite(led1, HIGH);  // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
        delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
        digitalWrite(led1, LOW);   // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
        delay(1000);                      // wait for a second


        digitalWrite(led2, HIGH);   // turn LED on
        delay(1000);                // wait for a second
        digitalWrite(led2, LOW);    // turn LED off
        delay(1000);                // wait for a second

        digitalWrite(led3, HIGH);   // turn LED on
        delay(1000);                // wait for a second
        digitalWrite(led3, LOW);    // turn LED off
        delay(1000);                // wait for a second
      }

    <p>2. The microcontroller has 20 ports, but 20 individual LEDs(~20 mA each) would exceed the 200 mA limit. So, based on that limit, it is safe to blink maximum 10 individual LEDs. </p>

    <p>3.  I did some research and found that there is a rate called critical flicker fusion frequency (CFF), where flickering light will be percieved as continuous at above 50-90 Hz. According to https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8537539/ </p>

    <p>4. In this assignment, I used chatGPT for assistance in formatting my webpage, when I was having issues. For example, one of the issues that I had was that my images would be cut off. I also used it to trouble shoot my issues with pushing to Git, I would use it to help decipher my error messages.  </p>
